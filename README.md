# Cool_DLIB_FLTK_Matrix_Demo

Cool DLIB (and TNT) FLTK Matrix Demo:

This is a general demo of a three dimentional martix rotation in 2D.  There is no OpenGL or other such 3D tool kits in use here.  I just felt like writing it for a friend, and have since been asked for the code by a few youtube viewers, so here it is.

There is now one version that using Dlib's (http://dlib.net/) Matrix Algebra facilities.  As well as a version using the TNT (https://math.nist.gov/tnt/overview.html) numerical library.
